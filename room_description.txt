Magic room
Upon entering the magic room, you might see walls that seem to change color or glow with an otherworldly light.
The floor might be made of glittering glass or soft, shimmering mist.
There might be floating objects or creatures that move in strange and unpredictable ways, and the air might be thick with the scent of magic and mystery.
You may also see chests filled with ancient tomes, strange instruments, and other magical objects. The overall atmosphere might be one of wonder, excitement, and a little bit of danger.
